This project is based on one simple idea that if any sequence contains a palindrom or
inverted reapeat, then the kmer count will be dominated by count of 2 if the kmers
are counter from both the forward and reverse direction.

Khai is the project lead and Christopher spend a lots of time to work on this
project.
